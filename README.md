# Coding Quiz

## Description

This is a quiz designed to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The quiz counts down as you answer questions and it utilizes the web storage API to store a history of high scores. 

This project was a great oppurtunity to play around with API's and DOM manipulation to show/hide things based on user interaction.
